    <h2 class="small-heading">How does it work?</h2>
    <p>We have partnered with the best Coworking Spaces in Berlin to give you a chance to try out all of them! With the help of an app and collective coworking membership One Coworking, all participants can get access to any of our partner spaces during the Festival Week. Registered participants will receive an email with detailed guidance and free voucher codes to be inserted into the app. This will allow them to  check in to a coworking space of their choice, be it for work or for an event. The use of the App is recommended but not required.
