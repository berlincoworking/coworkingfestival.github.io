To answer this, we’ve brought together a specialist panel who will share four different perspectives on best practices in technology and user experiences in coworking, at our interactive event held during Berlin Coworking Festival 2022 at Spaceshack Coworking on Tuesday 6th September, 2-5pm CEST.

The speakers joining us, and their topics of expertise brought to this event, includes:

Ben Lorenz, Space Shack: Troubleshooting coworking and facility tools - From payment and meeting room systems to home automation and access control, which tech problems do most coworking spaces need to solve?

Christian Schmitz, SALTO Systems: Innovation in access control - How does technology improve customer experience across the entire ecosystem?

Kristina Schneider Cobot: How can a coworking space management software help operators run, grow and automate their spaces, whilst creatively hacking and building upon existing systems?

Matthias Zeitler, Coworking Bansko: How powerful no-code tools automate your processes in coworking spaces, and which case studies exemplify the use of different technology integration solutions.

After briefly introducing these topics, our speakers will participate in a group discussion where you’ll have the opportunity to ask questions and share your thoughts interactively on the use of technology in coworking spaces.
This free event is open to all.

Um dies zu beantworten, haben wir auf unserer interaktiven Veranstaltung während des Berlin Coworking Festivals 2022 im Spaceshack Coworking am Dienstag, den 6. September, 14-17 Uhr, ein Expertengremium zusammengestellt, das vier verschiedene Perspektiven zu Best Practices in der Technologie und Benutzererfahrungen im Coworking teilt MESZ.

Zu den Rednern, die zu uns kommen, und ihren Fachthemen, die zu dieser Veranstaltung gebracht werden, gehören:

Ben Lorenz, Space Shack: Fehlerbehebung bei Coworking- und Facility-Tools - Von Zahlungs- und Besprechungsraumsystemen bis hin zu Heimautomatisierung und Zugangskontrolle, welche technischen Probleme müssen die meisten Coworking Spaces lösen?

Christian Schmitz, SALTO Systems: Innovation in der Zutrittskontrolle – Wie verbessert Technologie das Kundenerlebnis im gesamten Ökosystem?

Kristina Schneider Cobot: Wie kann eine Coworking-Space-Management-Software Betreibern helfen, ihre Spaces zu betreiben, zu erweitern und zu automatisieren, während sie gleichzeitig bestehende Systeme kreativ hacken und darauf aufbauen?

Matthias Zeitler, Coworking Bansko: Wie leistungsstarke No-Code-Tools Ihre Prozesse in Coworking Spaces automatisieren und welche Fallstudien den Einsatz verschiedener Technologie-Integrationslösungen veranschaulichen.

Nach einer kurzen Einführung in diese Themen werden unsere Referenten an einer Gruppendiskussion teilnehmen, in der Sie die Möglichkeit haben, Fragen zu stellen und Ihre Gedanken interaktiv zum Einsatz von Technologie in Coworking Spaces auszutauschen.

Man fand sich zwischen Lockdowns in einem Wilmersdorfer Wohnzimmer wieder und begann, sich einen alten Traum zu erfüllen. Between Balconies - das ist handgemachte Musik mit einem Augenzwinkern hier und da.

As part of the 2022 Berlin-Brandenburg Coworking Festival Week, we'll be trying dishes from different countries made by our members. Not only that, we openly welcome non-members to come and bring their dishes too! Don’t worry if you think you can’t cook – it doesn’t have to be complicated or fully made from scratch. You can even buy the dish from a local restaurant – as long as it represents your country and you are willing to share it with everyone else!

Please reach out to Valerie at info@tuesdaycoworking.com if you want to participate!
Come and experience new things with us!",2nd International Potluck Dinner,"Am Donnerstag (8. September) findet die 2. Ausgabe des International Potluck Dinner statt!

Im Rahmen der 2022 Berlin-Brandenburg Coworking Festival Week werden wir Gerichte aus verschiedenen Ländern probieren, die von unseren Mitgliedern zubereitet wurden. Aber nicht nur das, auch Nicht-Mitglieder sind herzlich eingeladen, ihre Gerichte mitzubringen! Keine Sorge, wenn du denkst, dass du nicht kochen kannst - es muss nicht kompliziert sein oder komplett von Grund auf neu gemacht werden. Du kannst das Gericht sogar in einem lokalen Restaurant kaufen - solange es dein Land repräsentiert und du bereit bist, es mit allen anderen zu teilen!

Bitte melde dich bei Valerie unter info@tuesdaycoworking.com, wenn du teilnehmen möchtest! Kommt und lasst uns mal neue Dinge kosten!",Thursday,6:30:00 PM,9:00:00 PM,,https://www.tuesdaycoworking.com/events/2nd-international-potluck-dinner/,No,tuesday
