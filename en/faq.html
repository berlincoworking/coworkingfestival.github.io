      <h2>What is coworking?</h2>
      <p>
        Coworking is about collaborating with the people around you, whether or not they’re in the same field or
        company. The aim is to provide a professional and social network without depending on a specific employer or
        company, and gaining more tools for flexibility and creative output. In short—it’s the new way to work.
