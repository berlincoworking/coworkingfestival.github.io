      <h3>Free Coworking Tour Berlin</h3>
      <p>
        Wednesday, September 7 2022 – 10:00am
      </p>
      <p>
        A tour with Matthias to explore the different coworking spaces in Berlin that are part of the Coworking Festival
        event.<br />
        Let's get inspired about how different operators and locations implement coworking.<br />
        This is a semi-self guided experience using public transport. It will go on for the whole day or until we get
        tired, but you can drop out the tour.<br />
        Meeting point is the U6 subway station "Seestrasse" in Wedding in front of the <a
          href="https://goo.gl/maps/1hQRBmZX8tvS8FHe6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Cafe Chokkolatta</a>
        at 10am. If you arrive earlier, have a coffee there.<br />
        Matthias will have an orange Coworking Bansko umbrella.<br />
        This is a free event but you will have to buy your own tickets for transport.<br />

      <h3>Free Coworking Tour Brandenburg</h3>
      <p>
        Thursday, September 8 2022 – 10:17-18:40 Uhr
      </p>
      <p>
        Our tour will start in Bad Belzig, where a new coworking space is being built in the train station and where the
        creative places "Sanderberger" and "Zukunftsschusterei" are located in the old town. Than we take the train to
        Wiesenburg/Mark. At Gleis 21 coworking, there is not only good WiFi for working purposes, but also nice people
        who give
        you an idea on working at the station and the future KoDorf plans. One result of creative work in our regin is
        the art
        trail. It starts right in front of Gleis 21. On a 1-1.5 hour walk you will experience a selection of artworks,
        the
        landscape park of Wiesenburg/Mark Castle and pure nature. And we share a glimpse of the next art project - an
        extension
        of the existing path with five AR artworks. We continue by bus to Klein Glien to visit Coconat - THE workation
        place in
        the region. Here you will get to know the wide range of workation offers from the Makerspace, to coworking in
        the S-Bahn
        wagon (what?!:-)), etc. Relax before you take the bus and train back home.
