description: "The juggleHUB is a coworking space, event location, café and, for many, something like a second home. Here, people with very different backgrounds and skills come together to work side by side – sometimes quietly, sometimes in exchange with others. Together, they allow a lively community to grow. 
In addition, juggleHUB is the first Berlin coworking space that offers flexible childcare. Coworking and childcare can, but are not required to go hand-in-hand. Our childcare service can be booked flexibly and as needed within our childcare hours. It is also available for those offering or attending events."
