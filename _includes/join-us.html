        <h3>Become a Participating Space</h3>
        <p>
          From September 11th – 15th 2023, coworking spaces in Berlin and Brandenburg will open their doors and invite the public to personally experience coworking. It’s an opportunity to engage with the wider community and demonstrate what so many professionals around the world have already figured out: Coworking is not only here to stay, it is reinventing our relationship with work.
