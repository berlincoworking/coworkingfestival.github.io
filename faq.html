      <p>
        Coworking is a new way of professional collaboration by people that not necessarily work on the same company or project. The aim is to provide a professional and social network without the dependency on a specific employment. That work is mostly done in flexible workspaces that are specifically organized and designed to meet the needs of coworkers.
